### **Cyclic White Hole Universe Theory – Simplified**

This theory proposes that black holes, instead of ending in singularities, may undergo a **quantum bounce** due to extreme density and quantum gravitational effects. As a result, the collapsed matter doesn't vanish but instead **flips inside out**, creating a **white hole** — a phenomenon that explosively ejects matter and energy. This white hole could then **become a new universe**, expanding from its own "Big Bang"-like event.

The theory suggests that **our universe may have formed this way**, emerging from a black hole in a parent universe. Over vast timescales, the process could repeat, forming a **cyclic model of universe creation**, where each black hole potentially births a new universe. While currently unprovable, the model aligns with some interpretations of **Loop Quantum Gravity**, **black hole thermodynamics**, and **cyclic cosmology**, offering a speculative but meaningful way to reimagine cosmic origins.

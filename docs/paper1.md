## **Document 1: Mathematical Foundations of the Cyclic White Hole Universe Theory**

**Title**: *Quantum-Gravitational Dynamics of Black Hole-Induced Universe Genesis*

### **1. Introduction**

This document explores the mathematical foundation of a cosmological theory proposing that black holes, upon reaching extreme density and gravitational compression, invert through quantum-gravitational mechanisms to form white holes — explosive spacetime regions analogous to the Big Bang. The resulting white hole manifests as a newly birthed universe, rendering our cosmos potentially the interior of such an entity.

### **2. Core Mathematical Constructs**

#### **2.1. Einstein Field Equations**

These govern the behavior of spacetime under general relativity:

$$
R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

As mass-energy increases (e.g. in a black hole), spacetime curvature becomes extreme. For a Schwarzschild black hole:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)c^2dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2d\Omega^2
$$

As $r \rightarrow 0$, curvature $R \rightarrow \infty$, suggesting a breakdown of classical physics.

#### **2.2. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) and the Big Bounce**

In LQG, spacetime is quantized. Singularities are avoided through quantum corrections that produce repulsive forces at Planck-scale densities.

The Friedmann equation modified by LQG:

$$
H^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3} \rho \left(1 - \frac{\rho}{\rho_c} \right)
$$

Where $\rho_c \sim \frac{0.41}{G^2 \hbar}$ is the critical density. As $\rho \rightarrow \rho_c$, $H \rightarrow 0$ and then reverses — implying a **bounce**.

#### **2.3. Black Hole Interior and Cosmogenesis**

Using Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates, the Schwarzschild black hole’s extended geometry includes regions beyond the singularity — white hole and parallel universe regions. The proposal here is to extend this further:

* **Collapse → Quantum Bounce → Expansion (White Hole)**
* Topology: $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ inside black hole
* Transition via Planck-scale bridge: Einstein–Rosen bridge (wormhole-like)

---

#### **2.4. Entropy and Holography**

* Bekenstein-Hawking entropy:

$$
S = \frac{k A}{4 \ell_p^2}
$$

Where $A$ is event horizon area, $\ell_p$ is Planck length.

If a black hole seeds a new universe, its entropy must be preserved or transformed — potentially encoding all matter/energy into a lower-dimensional surface (holography).

---

### **3. Conclusion**

This theory unites classical GR, quantum gravity (LQG), and holography to propose that each black hole can evolve into a universe. It offers a quantized cyclic model of cosmic rebirth.
